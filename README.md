## About this project
WeStudy is a matching system which allows admins to add students to the database and or delete them. This system is build with html css and javascript and node.js.

### Concept and Feature
My concept is about users that want to like a students based on their preferences. 
* My main focus is liking. The user can like persons who have (for now) not been liked before these persons will be shown at the match page.
* The user is also able to remove the like from the match/liked list.
* The user can also add a student to the database. 
* And delete a student from the database.
